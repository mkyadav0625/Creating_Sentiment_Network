# Creating_Sentiment_Network
In this project we we have developed a neural network model and refined it to create a sentiment network of words with positive and negative affinity

# Sentiment Classification & How To "Frame Problems" for a Neural Network

### What We Should Already Know
 * neural networks, forward and back-propagation
 * stochastic gradient descent
 * mean squared error
 * train/test splits

# Outline
 ### Project1 
 * Intro: The Importance of "Framing a Problem"
 * Curate a Dataset
 * Developing a "Predictive Theory"
 * Quick Theory Validation
  
 ### Project2 
 * Transforming Text to Numbers
 * Creating the Input/Output Data
 
 # Putting it all together in a Neural Network.
     Import the two previous projects
 
 ### Project3 
 * Building our Neural Network
 
 ### Project4
 * Understanding Neural Noise
 * Making Learning Faster by Reducing Noise
 
 ### Project5
 * Analyzing Inefficiencies in our Network
 * Making our Network Train and Run Faster
 
  ### Project6
 * Further Noise Reduction
 * Reducing Noise by Strategically Reducing the Vocabulary
 * Analysis: What's going on in the weights?
